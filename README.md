### Algorithms

  - [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) - Symmetric-key block cipher algorithm and U.S. government standard for secure and classified data encryption and decryption (also known as Rijndael).
  - [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) - One of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.
  - [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) - Widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, but it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.
  - [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) - Cryptographic hash function designed by the NSA. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value known as a message digest. SHA-1 is no longer considered secure against well-funded opponents.
  - [SHA2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) - Set of hash functions designed by the NSA. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds.
  - [SHA3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) - Cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size output, typically 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits, from variable-size input data. It is part of the SHA-3 family of cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from quantum computers and offers security properties such as pre-image resistance, second pre-image resistance, and collision resistance.
